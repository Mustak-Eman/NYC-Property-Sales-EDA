# Milestone 1: NYC Property Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains my Milestone 1 project for data analysis.  
The project explores relationships between **property size**, **sale price**, and **neighborhood** using the NYC Property Sales dataset.

## Contents
- `Milestone_1.ipynb` â€” Google Colab notebook with all code and plots  
- Data cleaning and visualization using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**  
- Insights and interpretation of property trends across neighborhoods

## Project Summary
- Cleaned and filtered the dataset for valid sale prices, land sizes, and construction years  
- Created single-variable and multi-variable plots to visualize patterns  
- Found that larger properties and certain neighborhoods (like Astoria) show higher sale prices
